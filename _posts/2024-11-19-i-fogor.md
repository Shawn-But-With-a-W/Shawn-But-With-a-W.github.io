# What's Been Happening?

In simple words, I forgot.

I somehow just managed to forget about both the existence of this page and how to use jekyll.

# Now What?

Going back to tutorial hell trying to figure out how to use this thing.

I will finally add the projects to the project page (no promises).

# More Notes

Ok I just tried to commit this and the page is not showing this blog time for half an hour of debugging nothing.

I'll also try making a copy of the "creating this site" blog and see what happens.

Ok coming back to this, the copy exists in the blog but this doesn't. Why? Watch it be some stupidly obvious reason I never realised.

I think I might just nuke this thing and start from scratch.
