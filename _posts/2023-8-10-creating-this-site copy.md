# Context

I've been thinking about making my own website for quite a while.

Before actually making this site, I've made a couple local webpages for school (which I will put in the projects page if I do remember) and an [organisation page](https://softwarecats.github.io/) with Github pages using HTML and CSS. I finally touched a bit JS in creating the n-body simulation for school recently.

Out of familiarity and being broke, Github pages was my hosting choice once again. Trying out something new as an excuse for being lazy, I tried Jekyll to turn markdown into webpages.

# Implementation

It was not worth it. I probably would've been better of had I started from scratch again.

I read through very long documentation and the Github guide on installing Jekyll. After running into a few problems with the command line it was eventually all sorted and I had a working site locally that was soon deployed but Github sites.

And then I realised I could've just stolen someone else's template for Jekyll.

After deleting the repository, creating a new one from the template and then carefully walking through the README (I have dyslexia if you can't tell already), I ran into a problem where the site would not deploy. The problem was made even worse by the command line producing errors when I try to host the site locally.

So back to the drawing board again, and the repository was swiftly deleted and created once more. Being scarred by previous experiences I made very small commits and stared at the action tab as the site was deployed for every commit. I think the reason for the site not deploying was because I commented out some stuff which made it unhappy.

Anyhow after many hours of making slight changes, pushing, deploying and checking the site, it seems to be functioning despite the amount of unnecessary bytes in the repository.

# What Now?

I'll probably display some projects and repos to this site, maybe use it to host my markdown notes if I ever figure that out.

I've also become surprisingly familiar with command line git because of writing way too many commits for this site.
