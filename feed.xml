I finally touched a bit JS in creating the n-body simulation for school recently.</p> <p>Out of familiarity and being broke, Github pages was my hosting choice once again. Trying out something new as an excuse for being lazy, I tried Jekyll to turn markdown into webpages.</p> <h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1> <p>It was not worth it. I probably would’ve been better of had I started from scratch again.</p> <p>I read through very long documentation and the Github guide on installing Jekyll. After running into a few problems with the command line it was eventually all sorted and I had a working site locally that was soon deployed but Github sites.</p> <p>And then I realised I could’ve just stolen someone else’s template for Jekyll.</p> <p>After deleting the repository, creating a new one from the template and then carefully walking through the README (I have dyslexia if you can’t tell already), I ran into a problem where the site would not deploy. The problem was made even worse by the command line producing errors when I try to host the site locally.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(complaining) about the process of creating this site]]></summary></entry></feed>
